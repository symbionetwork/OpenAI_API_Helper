# openai_helper
A helper module for moderation, content filtering, and GPT-3 endpoints using OpenAI's Python library

First, create a file named .env in the directory of this script, and put the following:

OPENAI_KEY = "key"
  
Replacing key with your OpenAI API key generated in your account. The only function that charges your OpenAI account is the get_gpt_response. The others are free. See additional information or instructions in the comments in the script. You can find the API docs here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/

If you have feedback regarding the script only, send it to contact@symbionetwork.com. Otherwise, contact OpenAI support.
